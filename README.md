# Cassels-Tate-pairing---Genus-2
MAGMA code for computing the Cassels-Tate pairing on the 2-Selmer group of a genus 2 Jacobian

This MAGMA code accompanies the papers

[1] T.A. Fisher and J. Yan, Computing the Cassels-Tate pairing on the 2-Selmer group of a genus 2 Jacobian
https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~taf1000/papers/genus2ctp.html

and

Attaching the files "g2minimisation.m" and "genus2ctp.m" will make available the intrinsics "TwoDescentGenus2" 
and "CasselsTatePairingGenus2". See the example at the top of "demo.m" for how to use these.

The files "g2ctp_examples.m" and "examples_LMFDB.m" contain examples that have been computed using this code.

The file "g2ctp_check_paper.m" gives further details of the formulae and examples in [1].
